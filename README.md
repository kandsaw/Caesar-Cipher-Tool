# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This project is a **Caesar Cipher** implementation in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based substitution cipher.

## 📜 Description
The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. This program allows users to:
- **Encrypt** a message by shifting letters forward.
- **Decrypt** a message by shifting letters backward.
- Handle **non-alphabetic characters** without modifications.

## 🚀 Features
- Simple **text-based user interface**.
- Allows users to **encrypt and decrypt** messages.
- **Handles special characters** and spaces without encryption.
- Option to **continue encrypting or decrypting** until the user decides to exit.
